The company supports agricultural production resources by distributing seeds fertilizers, chemicals, fuel, and farm machinery to the farms.\n\n\nCurrent Environment\n-\n\nThe company is migrating all applications from an on-premises datacenter to Microsoft Azure. Applications support distributors, farmers, and internal company staff.\n\n\nCorporate website\n-\n• The company hosts a public website located at http://www.munsonspicklesandpreservesfarm.com. The site supports farmers and distributors who request agricultural production resources.\n\n\nFarms\n-\n• The company created a new customer tenant in the Microsoft Entra admin center to support authentication and authorization for applications.\n\n\nDistributors\n-\n• Distributors integrate their applications with data that is accessible by using APIs hosted at http://www.munsonspicklesandpreservesfarm.com/api to receive and update resource data.\n\n\nRequirements\n-\n\nThe application components must meet the following requirements:\n\n\nCorporate website\n-\n• The site must be migrated to Azure App Service.\n• Costs must be minimized when hosting in Azure.\n• Applications must automatically scale independent of the compute resources.\n• All code changes must be validated by internal staff before release to production.\n• File transfer speeds must improve, and webpage-load performance must increase.\n• All site settings must be centrally stored, secured without using secrets, and encrypted at rest and in transit.\n• A queue-based load leveling pattern must be implemented by using Azure Service Bus queues to support high volumes of website agricultural production resource requests.\n\n\nFarms\n-\n• Farmers must authenticate to applications by using Microsoft Entra ID.\n\n\nDistributors\n-\n• The company must track a custom telemetry value with each API call and monitor performance of all APIs.\n• API telemetry values must be charted to evaluate variations and trends for resource data.\n\n\nInternal staff\n-\n• App and API updates must be validated before release to production.\n• Staff must be able to select a link to direct them back to the production app when validating an app or API update.\n• Staff profile photos and email must be displayed on the website once they authenticate to applications by using their Microsoft Entra ID.\n\n\nSecurity\n-\n• All web communications must be secured by using TLS/HTTPS.\n• Web content must be restricted by country/region to support corporate compliance standards.\n• The principle of least privilege must be applied when providing any user rights or process access rights.\n• Managed identities for Azure resources must be used to authenticate services that support Microsoft Entra ID authentication.\n\n\nIssues\n-\n\n\nCorporate website\n-\n• Farmers report HTTP 503 errors at the same time as internal staff report that CPU and memory usage are high.\n• Distributors report HTTP 502 errors at the same time as internal staff report that average response times and networking traffic are high.\n• Internal staff report webpage load sizes are large and take a long time to load.\n• Developers receive authentication errors to Service Bus when they debug locally.\n\n\nDistributors\n-\n• Many API telemetry values are sent in a short period of time. Telemetry traffic, data costs, and storage costs must be reduced while preserving a statistically correct analysis of the data points sent by the APIs.\n\n\nYou need to configure App Service to support the corporate website migration.\n\nWhich configuration should you use?

When you are ready to answer a question, click the Question button to return to the question.\n\n\nBackground\n-\n\nVanArsdel, Ltd. is a global office supply company. The company is based in Canada and has retail store locations across the world. The company is developing several cloud-based solutions to support their stores, distributors, suppliers, and delivery services.\n\n\nCurrent environment\n-\n\n\nCorporate website\n-\n\nThe company provides a public website located at http://www.vanarsdelltd.com. The website consists of a React JavaScript user interface, HTML, CSS, image assets, and several APIs hosted in Azure Functions.\n\n\nRetail Store Locations\n-\n\nThe company supports thousands of store locations globally. Store locations send data every hour to an Azure Blob storage account to support inventory, purchasing and delivery services. Each record includes a location identifier and sales transaction information.\n\n\nRequirements\n-\n\nThe application components must meet the following requirements:\n\n\nCorporate website\n-\n\n• Secure the website by using SSL.\n• Minimize costs for data storage and hosting.\n• Implement native GitHub workflows for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).\n• Distribute the website content globally for local use.\n• Implement monitoring by using Application Insights and availability web tests including SSL certificate validity and custom header value verification.\n• The website must have 99.95 percent uptime.\n\n\nRetail store locations\n-\n\n• Azure Functions must process data immediately when data is uploaded to Blob storage. Azure Functions must update Azure Cosmos DB by using native SQL language queries.\n• Audit store sale transaction information nightly to validate data, process sales financials, and reconcile inventory.\n\n\nDelivery services\n-\n\n• Store service telemetry data in Azure Cosmos DB by using an Azure Function. Data must include an item id, the delivery vehicle license plate, vehicle package capacity, and current vehicle location coordinates.\n• Store delivery driver profile information in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) by using an Azure Function called from the corporate website.\n\n\nInventory services\n-\n\nThe company has contracted a third-party to develop an API for inventory processing that requires access to a specific blob within the retail store storage account for three months to\ninclude read-only access to the data.\n\n\nSecurity\n-\n\n• All Azure Functions must centralize management and distribution of configuration data for different environments and geographies, encrypted by using a company-provided RSA-HSM key.\n• Authentication and authorization must use Azure AD and services must use managed identities where possible.\n\n\nIssues\n-\n\n\nRetail Store Locations\n-\n\n• You must perform a point-in-time restoration of the retail store location data due to an unexpected and accidental deletion of data.\n• Azure Cosmos DB queries from the Azure Function exhibit high Request Unit (RU) usage and contain multiple, complex queries that exhibit high point read latency for large items as the function app is scaling.\n\n\nYou need to implement the delivery service telemetry data.\n\nHow should you configure the solution?

Once processing is completed, results are stored in Azure Blob\nStorage and an Azure SQL database. Then, an email summary is sent to the user with a link to the processing report. The link to the report must remain valid if the email is forwarded to another user.\n\nLogging -\nAzure Application Insights is used for telemetry and logging in both the processor and the web application. The processor also has TraceWriter logging enabled.\nApplication Insights must always contain all log messages.\n\nRequirements -\n\nReceipt processing -\nConcurrent processing of a receipt must be prevented.\n\nDisaster recovery -\nRegional outage must not impact application availability. All DR operations must not be dependent on application running and must ensure that data in the DR region is up to date.\n\nSecurity -\nUser's SecurityPin must be stored in such a way that access to the database does not allow the viewing of SecurityPins. The web application is the only system that should have access to SecurityPins.\nAll certificates and secrets used to secure data must be stored in Azure Key Vault.\nYou must adhere to the principle of least privilege and provide privileges which are essential to perform the intended function.\nAll access to Azure Storage and Azure SQL database must use the application's Managed Service Identity (MSI).\nReceipt data must always be encrypted at rest.\nAll data must be protected in transit.\nUser's expense account number must be visible only to logged in users. All other views of the expense account number should include only the last segment, with the remaining parts obscured.\nIn the case of a security breach, access to all summary reports must be revoked without impacting other parts of the system.\n\nIssues -\n\nUpload format issue -\nEmployees occasionally report an issue with uploading a receipt using the web application. They report that when they upload a receipt using the Azure File\nShare, the receipt does not appear in their profile. When this occurs, they delete the file in the file share and use the web application, which returns a 500 Internal\nServer error page.\n\nCapacity issue -\nDuring busy periods, employees report long delays between the time they upload the receipt and when it appears in the web application.\n\nLog capacity issue -\nDevelopers report that the number of log messages in the trace output for the processor is too high, resulting in lost log messages.\n\nApplication code -\n\nProcessing.cs -\n\n\nDatabase.cs -\n\n\nReceiptUploader.cs -\n\n\nConfigureSSE.ps1 -\n\nQuestion\nDRAG DROP -\nYou need to add code at line PC32 in Processing.cs to implement the GetCredentials method in the Processing class.\nHow should you complete the code?

The link to the report must remain valid if the email is forwarded to another user.\n\nLogging -\nAzure Application Insights is used for telemetry and logging in both the processor and the web application. The processor also has TraceWriter logging enabled.\nApplication Insights must always contain all log messages.\n\nRequirements -\n\nReceipt processing -\nConcurrent processing of a receipt must be prevented.\n\nDisaster recovery -\nRegional outage must not impact application availability. All DR operations must not be dependent on application running and must ensure that data in the DR region is up to date.\n\nSecurity -\nUser's SecurityPin must be stored in such a way that access to the database does not allow the viewing of SecurityPins. The web application is the only system that should have access to SecurityPins.\nAll certificates and secrets used to secure data must be stored in Azure Key Vault.\nYou must adhere to the principle of least privilege and provide privileges which are essential to perform the intended function.\nAll access to Azure Storage and Azure SQL database must use the application's Managed Service Identity (MSI).\nReceipt data must always be encrypted at rest.\nAll data must be protected in transit.\nUser's expense account number must be visible only to logged in users. All other views of the expense account number should include only the last segment, with the remaining parts obscured.\nIn the case of a security breach, access to all summary reports must be revoked without impacting other parts of the system.\n\nIssues -\n\nUpload format issue -\nEmployees occasionally report an issue with uploading a receipt using the web application. They report that when they upload a receipt using the Azure File\nShare, the receipt does not appear in their profile. When this occurs, they delete the file in the file share and use the web application, which returns a 500 Internal\nServer error page.\n\nCapacity issue -\nDuring busy periods, employees report long delays between the time they upload the receipt and when it appears in the web application.\n\nLog capacity issue -\nDevelopers report that the number of log messages in the trace output for the processor is too high, resulting in lost log messages.\n\nApplication code -\n\nProcessing.cs -\n\n\nDatabase.cs -\n\n\nReceiptUploader.cs -\n\n\nConfigureSSE.ps1 -\n\nQuestion\nDRAG DROP -\nYou need to ensure disaster recovery requirements are met.\nWhat code should you add at line PC16?\nTo answer, drag the appropriate code fragments to the correct locations. Each code fragment may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.\nNOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.\nSelect and Place:\n\n",

The website uses files stored in Azure Storage and cached in Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve static content.\nAPI Management and Azure Function App functions are used to process and store data in Azure Database for PostgreSQL. API Management is used to broker communications to the Azure Function app functions for Logic app integration. Logic apps are used to orchestrate the data processing while Service Bus and\nEvent Grid handle messaging and events.\nThe solution uses Application Insights, Azure Monitor, and Azure Key Vault.\n\nArchitecture diagram -\nThe company has several applications and services that support their business. The company plans to implement serverless computing where possible. The overall architecture is shown below.\n\n\nUser authentication -\nThe following steps detail the user authentication process:\n1. The user selects Sign in in the website.\n2. The browser redirects the user to the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) sign in page.\n3. The user signs in.\n4. Azure AD redirects the user's session back to the web application. The URL includes an access token.\n5. The web application calls an API and includes the access token in the authentication header. The application ID is sent as the audience ('aud') claim in the access token.\n6. The back-end API validates the access token.\n\nRequirements -\n\nCorporate website -\nCommunications and content must be secured by using SSL.\nCommunications must use HTTPS.\nData must be replicated to a secondary region and three availability zones.\nData storage costs must be minimized.\n\nAzure Database for PostgreSQL -\nThe database connection string is stored in Azure Key Vault with the following attributes:\nAzure Key Vault name: cpandlkeyvault\nSecret name: PostgreSQLConn\nId: 80df3e46ffcd4f1cb187f79905e9a1e8\nThe connection information is updated frequently. The application must always use the latest information to connect to the database.\nAzure Service Bus and Azure Event Grid\nAzure Event Grid must use Azure Service Bus for queue-based load leveling.\nEvents in Azure Event Grid must be routed directly to Service Bus queues for use in buffering.\nEvents from Azure Service Bus and other Azure services must continue to be routed to Azure Event Grid for processing.\n\nSecurity -\nAll SSL certificates and credentials must be stored in Azure Key Vault.\nFile access must restrict access by IP, protocol, and Azure AD rights.\nAll user accounts and processes must receive only those privileges which are essential to perform their intended function.\n\nCompliance -\nAuditing of the file updates and transfers must be enabled to comply with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The file updates must be read-only, stored in the order in which they occurred, include only create, update, delete, and copy operations, and be retained for compliance reasons.\n\nIssues -\n\nCorporate website -\nWhile testing the site, the following error message displays:\nCryptographicException: The system cannot find the file specified.\n\nFunction app -\nYou perform local testing for the RequestUserApproval function. The following error message displays:\n'Timeout value of 00:10:00 exceeded by function: RequestUserApproval'\nThe same error message displays when you test the function in an Azure development environment when you run the following Kusto query:\n\nFunctionAppLogs -\n| where FunctionName = = \"RequestUserApproval\"\n\nLogic app -\nYou test the Logic app in a development environment. The following error message displays:\n'400 Bad Request'\nTroubleshooting of the error shows an HttpTrigger action to call the RequestUserApproval function.\n\nCode -\n\nCorporate website -\nSecurity.cs:\n\n\nFunction app -\nRequestUserApproval.cs:\n\nQuestion\nDRAG DROP -\nYou need to correct the corporate website error.\nWhich four actions should you recommend be performed in sequence? To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list of actions to the answer area and arrange them in the correct order.\nSelect and Place:\n\n",

Use the buttons in the left pane to explore the content of the case study before you answer the questions. Clicking these buttons displays information such as business requirements, existing environment, and problem statements. When you are ready to answer a question, click the Question button to return to the question.\n\nBackground -\nYou are a developer for Litware Inc., a SaaS company that provides a solution for managing employee expenses. The solution consists of an ASP.NET Core Web\nAPI project that is deployed as an Azure Web App.\n\nOverall architecture -\nEmployees upload receipts for the system to process. When processing is complete, the employee receives a summary report email that details the processing results. Employees then use a web application to manage their receipts and perform any additional tasks needed for reimbursement.\n\nReceipt processing -\nEmployees may upload receipts in two ways:\nUploading using an Azure Files mounted folder\nUploading using the web application\n\nData Storage -\nReceipt and employee information is stored in an Azure SQL database.\n\nDocumentation -\nEmployees are provided with a getting started document when they first use the solution. The documentation includes details on supported operating systems for\nAzure File upload, and instructions on how to configure the mounted folder.\n\nSolution details -\n\nUsers table -\n\n\nWeb Application -\nYou enable MSI for the Web App and configure the Web App to use the security principal name WebAppIdentity.\n\nProcessing -\nProcessing is performed by an Azure Function that uses version 2 of the Azure Function runtime. Once processing is completed, results are stored in Azure Blob\nStorage and an Azure SQL database. Then, an email summary is sent to the user with a link to the processing report. The link to the report must remain valid if the email is forwarded to another user.\n\nLogging -\nAzure Application Insights is used for telemetry and logging in both the processor and the web application. The processor also has TraceWriter logging enabled.\nApplication Insights must always contain all log messages.\n\nRequirements -\n\nReceipt processing -\nConcurrent processing of a receipt must be prevented.\n\nDisaster recovery -\nRegional outage must not impact application availability. All DR operations must not be dependent on application running and must ensure that data in the DR region is up to date.\n\nSecurity -\nUser's SecurityPin must be stored in such a way that access to the database does not allow the viewing of SecurityPins. The web application is the only system that should have access to SecurityPins.\nAll certificates and secrets used to secure data must be stored in Azure Key Vault.\nYou must adhere to the principle of least privilege and provide privileges which are essential to perform the intended function.\nAll access to Azure Storage and Azure SQL database must use the application's Managed Service Identity (MSI).\nReceipt data must always be encrypted at rest.\nAll data must be protected in transit.\nUser's expense account number must be visible only to logged in users.

When you are ready to answer a question, click the Question button to return to the question.\n\nBackground -\nYou are a developer for Litware Inc., a SaaS company that provides a solution for managing employee expenses. The solution consists of an ASP.NET Core Web\nAPI project that is deployed as an Azure Web App.\n\nOverall architecture -\nEmployees upload receipts for the system to process. When processing is complete, the employee receives a summary report email that details the processing results. Employees then use a web application to manage their receipts and perform any additional tasks needed for reimbursement.\n\nReceipt processing -\nEmployees may upload receipts in two ways:\nUploading using an Azure Files mounted folder\nUploading using the web application\n\nData Storage -\nReceipt and employee information is stored in an Azure SQL database.\n\nDocumentation -\nEmployees are provided with a getting started document when they first use the solution. The documentation includes details on supported operating systems for\nAzure File upload, and instructions on how to configure the mounted folder.\n\nSolution details -\n\nUsers table -\n\n\nWeb Application -\nYou enable MSI for the Web App and configure the Web App to use the security principal name WebAppIdentity.\n\nProcessing -\nProcessing is performed by an Azure Function that uses version 2 of the Azure Function runtime. Once processing is completed, results are stored in Azure Blob\nStorage and an Azure SQL database. Then, an email summary is sent to the user with a link to the processing report. The link to the report must remain valid if the email is forwarded to another user.\n\nLogging -\nAzure Application Insights is used for telemetry and logging in both the processor and the web application. The processor also has TraceWriter logging enabled.\nApplication Insights must always contain all log messages.\n\nRequirements -\n\nReceipt processing -\nConcurrent processing of a receipt must be prevented.\n\nDisaster recovery -\nRegional outage must not impact application availability. All DR operations must not be dependent on application running and must ensure that data in the DR region is up to date.\n\nSecurity -\nUser's SecurityPin must be stored in such a way that access to the database does not allow the viewing of SecurityPins. The web application is the only system that should have access to SecurityPins.\nAll certificates and secrets used to secure data must be stored in Azure Key Vault.\nYou must adhere to the principle of least privilege and provide privileges which are essential to perform the intended function.\nAll access to Azure Storage and Azure SQL database must use the application's Managed Service Identity (MSI).\nReceipt data must always be encrypted at rest.\nAll data must be protected in transit.\nUser's expense account number must be visible only to logged in users. All other views of the expense account number should include only the last segment, with the remaining parts obscured.\nIn the case of a security breach, access to all summary reports must be revoked without impacting other parts of the system.\n\nIssues -\n\nUpload format issue -\nEmployees occasionally report an issue with uploading a receipt using the web application. They report that when they upload a receipt using the Azure File\nShare, the receipt does not appear in their profile. When this occurs, they delete the file in the file share and use the web application, which returns a 500 Internal\nServer error page.\n\nCapacity issue -\nDuring busy periods, employees report long delays between the time they upload the receipt and when it appears in the web application.\n\nLog capacity issue -\nDevelopers report that the number of log messages in the trace output for the processor is too high, resulting in lost log messages.\n\nApplication code -\n\nProcessing.cs -\n\n\nDatabase.cs -\n\n\nReceiptUploader.cs -\n\n\nConfigureSSE.ps1 -\n\nQuestion\nYou need to ensure the security policies are met.\nWhat code do you add at line CS07 of ConfigureSSE.ps1?\n",

The browser redirects the user to the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) sign in page.\n3. The user signs in.\n4. Azure AD redirects the user's session back to the web application. The URL includes an access token.\n5. The web application calls an API and includes the access token in the authentication header. The application ID is sent as the audience ('aud') claim in the access token.\n6. The back-end API validates the access token.\n\nRequirements -\n\nCorporate website -\nCommunications and content must be secured by using SSL.\nCommunications must use HTTPS.\nData must be replicated to a secondary region and three availability zones.\nData storage costs must be minimized.\n\nAzure Database for PostgreSQL -\nThe database connection string is stored in Azure Key Vault with the following attributes:\nAzure Key Vault name: cpandlkeyvault\nSecret name: PostgreSQLConn\nId: 80df3e46ffcd4f1cb187f79905e9a1e8\nThe connection information is updated frequently. The application must always use the latest information to connect to the database.\nAzure Service Bus and Azure Event Grid\nAzure Event Grid must use Azure Service Bus for queue-based load leveling.\nEvents in Azure Event Grid must be routed directly to Service Bus queues for use in buffering.\nEvents from Azure Service Bus and other Azure services must continue to be routed to Azure Event Grid for processing.\n\nSecurity -\nAll SSL certificates and credentials must be stored in Azure Key Vault.\nFile access must restrict access by IP, protocol, and Azure AD rights.\nAll user accounts and processes must receive only those privileges which are essential to perform their intended function.\n\nCompliance -\nAuditing of the file updates and transfers must be enabled to comply with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The file updates must be read-only, stored in the order in which they occurred, include only create, update, delete, and copy operations, and be retained for compliance reasons.\n\nIssues -\n\nCorporate website -\nWhile testing the site, the following error message displays:\nCryptographicException: The system cannot find the file specified.\n\nFunction app -\nYou perform local testing for the RequestUserApproval function. The following error message displays:\n'Timeout value of 00:10:00 exceeded by function: RequestUserApproval'\nThe same error message displays when you test the function in an Azure development environment when you run the following Kusto query:\n\nFunctionAppLogs -\n| where FunctionName = = \"RequestUserApproval\"\n\nLogic app -\nYou test the Logic app in a development environment. The following error message displays:\n'400 Bad Request'\nTroubleshooting of the error shows an HttpTrigger action to call the RequestUserApproval function.\n\nCode -\n\nCorporate website -\nSecurity.cs:\n\n\nFunction app -\nRequestUserApproval.cs:\n\nQuestion\nYou need to correct the RequestUserApproval Function app error.\nWhat should you do?\n",

When you are ready to answer a question, click the Question button to return to the question.\n\nBackground -\nYou are a developer for Litware Inc., a SaaS company that provides a solution for managing employee expenses. The solution consists of an ASP.NET Core Web\nAPI project that is deployed as an Azure Web App.\n\nOverall architecture -\nEmployees upload receipts for the system to process. When processing is complete, the employee receives a summary report email that details the processing results. Employees then use a web application to manage their receipts and perform any additional tasks needed for reimbursement.\n\nReceipt processing -\nEmployees may upload receipts in two ways:\nUploading using an Azure Files mounted folder\nUploading using the web application\n\nData Storage -\nReceipt and employee information is stored in an Azure SQL database.\n\nDocumentation -\nEmployees are provided with a getting started document when they first use the solution. The documentation includes details on supported operating systems for\nAzure File upload, and instructions on how to configure the mounted folder.\n\nSolution details -\n\nUsers table -\n\n\nWeb Application -\nYou enable MSI for the Web App and configure the Web App to use the security principal name WebAppIdentity.\n\nProcessing -\nProcessing is performed by an Azure Function that uses version 2 of the Azure Function runtime. Once processing is completed, results are stored in Azure Blob\nStorage and an Azure SQL database. Then, an email summary is sent to the user with a link to the processing report. The link to the report must remain valid if the email is forwarded to another user.\n\nLogging -\nAzure Application Insights is used for telemetry and logging in both the processor and the web application. The processor also has TraceWriter logging enabled.\nApplication Insights must always contain all log messages.\n\nRequirements -\n\nReceipt processing -\nConcurrent processing of a receipt must be prevented.\n\nDisaster recovery -\nRegional outage must not impact application availability. All DR operations must not be dependent on application running and must ensure that data in the DR region is up to date.\n\nSecurity -\nUser's SecurityPin must be stored in such a way that access to the database does not allow the viewing of SecurityPins. The web application is the only system that should have access to SecurityPins.\nAll certificates and secrets used to secure data must be stored in Azure Key Vault.\nYou must adhere to the principle of least privilege and provide privileges which are essential to perform the intended function.\nAll access to Azure Storage and Azure SQL database must use the application's Managed Service Identity (MSI).\nReceipt data must always be encrypted at rest.\nAll data must be protected in transit.\nUser's expense account number must be visible only to logged in users. All other views of the expense account number should include only the last segment, with the remaining parts obscured.\nIn the case of a security breach, access to all summary reports must be revoked without impacting other parts of the system.\n\nIssues -\n\nUpload format issue -\nEmployees occasionally report an issue with uploading a receipt using the web application. They report that when they upload a receipt using the Azure File\nShare, the receipt does not appear in their profile. When this occurs, they delete the file in the file share and use the web application, which returns a 500 Internal\nServer error page.\n\nCapacity issue -\nDuring busy periods, employees report long delays between the time they upload the receipt and when it appears in the web application.\n\nLog capacity issue -\nDevelopers report that the number of log messages in the trace output for the processor is too high, resulting in lost log messages.\n\nApplication code -\n\nProcessing.cs -\n\n\nDatabase.cs -\n\n\nReceiptUploader.cs -\n\n\nConfigureSSE.ps1 -\n\nQuestion\nYou need to resolve the log capacity issue.\nWhat should you do?\n",

The company is developing several cloud-based solutions to support their stores, distributors, suppliers, and delivery services.\n\nCurrent environment -\n\nCorporate website -\nThe company provides a public website located at http://www.vanarsdelltd.com. The website consists of a React JavaScript user interface, HTML, CSS, image assets, and several APIs hosted in Azure Functions.\n\nRetail Store Locations -\nThe company supports thousands of store locations globally. Store locations send data every hour to an Azure Blob storage account to support inventory, purchasing and delivery services. Each record includes a location identifier and sales transaction information.\n\nRequirements -\nThe application components must meet the following requirements:\n\nCorporate website -\nSecure the website by using SSL.\nMinimize costs for data storage and hosting.\nImplement native GitHub workflows for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).\nDistribute the website content globally for local use.\nImplement monitoring by using Application Insights and availability web tests including SSL certificate validity and custom header value verification.\nThe website must have 99.95 percent uptime.\n\nRetail store locations -\nAzure Functions must process data immediately when data is uploaded to Blob storage. Azure Functions must update Azure Cosmos DB by using native SQL language queries.\nAudit store sale transaction information nightly to validate data, process sales financials, and reconcile inventory.\n\nDelivery services -\nStore service telemetry data in Azure Cosmos DB by using an Azure Function. Data must include an item id, the delivery vehicle license plate, vehicle package capacity, and current vehicle location coordinates.\nStore delivery driver profile information in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) by using an Azure Function called from the corporate website.\n\nInventory services -\nThe company has contracted a third-party to develop an API for inventory processing that requires access to a specific blob within the retail store storage account for three months to include read-only access to the data.\n\nSecurity -\nAll Azure Functions must centralize management and distribution of configuration data for different environments and geographies, encrypted by using a company-provided RSA-HSM key.\nAuthentication and authorization must use Azure AD and services must use managed identities where possible.\n\nIssues -\n\nRetail Store Locations -\nYou must perform a point-in-time restoration of the retail store location data due to an unexpected and accidental deletion of data.\nAzure Cosmos DB queries from the Azure Function exhibit high Request Unit (RU) usage and contain multiple, complex queries that exhibit high point read latency for large items as the function app is scaling.\nQuestion\nHOTSPOT -\nYou need to implement event routing for retail store location data.\nWhich configurations should you use?

When you are ready to answer a question, click the Question button to return to the question.\n\nBackground -\nCity Power & Light company provides electrical infrastructure monitoring solutions for homes and businesses. The company is migrating solutions to Azure.\n\nCurrent environment -\n\nArchitecture overview -\nThe company has a public website located at http://www.cpandl.com/. The site is a single-page web application that runs in Azure App Service on Linux. The website uses files stored in Azure Storage and cached in Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve static content.\nAPI Management and Azure Function App functions are used to process and store data in Azure Database for PostgreSQL. API Management is used to broker communications to the Azure Function app functions for Logic app integration. Logic apps are used to orchestrate the data processing while Service Bus and\nEvent Grid handle messaging and events.\nThe solution uses Application Insights, Azure Monitor, and Azure Key Vault.\n\nArchitecture diagram -\nThe company has several applications and services that support their business. The company plans to implement serverless computing where possible. The overall architecture is shown below.\n\n\nUser authentication -\nThe following steps detail the user authentication process:\n1. The user selects Sign in in the website.\n2. The browser redirects the user to the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) sign in page.\n3. The user signs in.\n4. Azure AD redirects the user's session back to the web application. The URL includes an access token.\n5. The web application calls an API and includes the access token in the authentication header. The application ID is sent as the audience ('aud') claim in the access token.\n6. The back-end API validates the access token.\n\nRequirements -\n\nCorporate website -\nCommunications and content must be secured by using SSL.\nCommunications must use HTTPS.\nData must be replicated to a secondary region and three availability zones.\nData storage costs must be minimized.\n\nAzure Database for PostgreSQL -\nThe database connection string is stored in Azure Key Vault with the following attributes:\nAzure Key Vault name: cpandlkeyvault\nSecret name: PostgreSQLConn\nId: 80df3e46ffcd4f1cb187f79905e9a1e8\nThe connection information is updated frequently. The application must always use the latest information to connect to the database.\nAzure Service Bus and Azure Event Grid\nAzure Event Grid must use Azure Service Bus for queue-based load leveling.\nEvents in Azure Event Grid must be routed directly to Service Bus queues for use in buffering.\nEvents from Azure Service Bus and other Azure services must continue to be routed to Azure Event Grid for processing.\n\nSecurity -\nAll SSL certificates and credentials must be stored in Azure Key Vault.\nFile access must restrict access by IP, protocol, and Azure AD rights.\nAll user accounts and processes must receive only those privileges which are essential to perform their intended function.\n\nCompliance -\nAuditing of the file updates and transfers must be enabled to comply with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The file updates must be read-only, stored in the order in which they occurred, include only create, update, delete, and copy operations, and be retained for compliance reasons.\n\nIssues -\n\nCorporate website -\nWhile testing the site, the following error message displays:\nCryptographicException: The system cannot find the file specified.\n\nFunction app -\nYou perform local testing for the RequestUserApproval function. The following error message displays:\n'Timeout value of 00:10:00 exceeded by function: RequestUserApproval'\nThe same error message displays when you test the function in an Azure development environment when you run the following Kusto query:\n\nFunctionAppLogs -\n| where FunctionName = = \"RequestUserApproval\"\n\nLogic app -\nYou test the Logic app in a development environment. The following error message displays:\n'400 Bad Request'\nTroubleshooting of the error shows an HttpTrigger action to call the RequestUserApproval function.\n\nCode -\n\nCorporate website -\nSecurity.cs:\n\n\nFunction app -\nRequestUserApproval.cs:\n\nQuestion\nHOTSPOT -\nYou need to configure the Account Kind, Replication, and Access tier options for the corporate website's Azure Storage account.\nHow should you complete the configuration? To answer, select the appropriate options in the dialog box in the answer area.\nNOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.\nHot Area:\n\n",
